create ~/ws/architecture-c4.md with the c4 level 1 and 2 diagrams of this workspace using devac cli do not use the devac mcp, skip
the worktrees as they are duplicates and also skip likec4 and vivief as they are tools we like to exclude. 
include a chapter at the end with full explainers on how and why and where you retrieved the information to create the document also be liberal in adding
confidence markers where you think they are relevant*

one interference:

Tool use rejected with user message: why are you not simply using devac cli query as you did before. it seems we do not understand
the task as you wander of into devac cli commands that are not there to query the seeds. do you need more guidance on the intent of
devac cli to retrieve the needed information on the workspace*

also note i forgot to exclude living architecture dir
